We have to do planning - first of all ->
Food ordering app - Namaste Food
1) Have a header
    logo inside header
    after logo have some links(Home, About, cart)

2) Body
    Search Bar
    Restaurant container
    Restaurant cards
        have image, name, rating etc...
    
3) Footer
    Copy right
    and some links

props -> short form for properties
Just normal arguments to a function.(like passing an arguments to a function)

Destructuring on fly
{resName, cuisine} -> props

Config Driven UI ->
Our website is driven by data (using config comes from back-end)

Swiggy -> used cloudinary image id
