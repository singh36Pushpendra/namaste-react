React also uses js.
The beauty of using a framework or library is it makes developer experience easy.

React hooks ->
A best practice ->
Make separate file for separate components.
Never ever keep any hard coded data or string into component file.

Some people also like to use .jsx extension.
for typescript use .tsx

What is a good way?
.js, or .jsx no matter makes 0 difference.


// import Header from "./components/Header.js";
import Header from "./components/Header";

can use extension over import but without extension also works.

Two types of export and import
Default export/import ->
    export default Component;
    import Component from "path";

Named export/import ->
    export const Component;
    import {Component} from "path";
