React also uses js.
The beauty of using a framework or library is it makes developer experience easy.

React hooks ->
A best practice ->
Make separate file for separate components.
Never ever keep any hard coded data or string into component file.
Keep it in a Config.js, Constant.js ... inside folder like 
utils or commons ...

Folder structure ->
Industry Convention ->
src ->
    components ->

Some people also like to use .jsx extension.
for typescript use .tsx

What is a good way?
.js, or .jsx no matter makes 0 difference.


// import Header from "./components/Header.js";
import Header from "./components/Header";

can use extension over import but without extension also works.

Two types of export and import
Default export/import ->
    export default Component;
    import Component from "path";

Named export/import ->
    export const Component;
    import {Component} from "path";

A good practice is to keep default export unless there is no two named variable.

Can we use default export along with the named export?

Event Handlers ->

Refreshing onClick of Button.

React is fast in DOM manipulation.

React Hooks -> a normal JS function 

Whenever a state variable updates react will re-renders our components.

React Algorithm -> Uses reconciliation algorithm(also known as react fibers, come in React-16)
DOM is like a tree ->
res-container -> have restaurant cards
React creates Virtual DOM not an actual DOM(which are tags(react elements)).
Virtual DOM is representation of actual DOM.
React Virtual DOM is nothing but a javascript object.

Diff algorithm -> Finds out the difference between two virtual DOM
                    (old and new virtual DOM)
                    Calculate difference and then updates actual DOM.
