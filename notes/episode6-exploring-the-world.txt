Monolith Architecture -> Earlier developed using this.
Earlier: API, UI code, Auth, DB, SMS inside same project

Microservices Architecture -> Different services for different jobs.
Back-End, UI, Auth, DB, SMS, Email Notification combine together forms a big app.
separation of concerns (single responsibility principle)
How do these services interact with each other?

Namaste React is a "UI microservice".

Can used different language for different services when using microservice.
Eg like: Back-end => Java, DB => python, UI - react

All services will be run in on there own specific port->
Eg like:-
1234 - UI
1000 - BE
3000 - SMS

On different ports we can deploy different service->
Eg like:-
/ - UI
/api - BE
/sms - SMS

How a react application will make connection to different services?

How UI fetch the data from back-end using two ways?
1) As soon as our page loads, we can make an api call, wait for data
    to come then render it to ui.
    Eg: Loads => API => Render
                500ms

2) As soon as the page loads, we will just render UI quickly.
    Loads => Render => API => Render again
            skeleton

In react we will always be using 2nd approach.(Better approach gives better UX)
React renders UI very fast.

Our browsers not allowing to call from different origin and i.e., a CORS policy.
There is a way we can get rid of CORS error.
Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin.

CORS ->
Same origin(domain name) can share
Different origin
